## `Data_Experiments`
This notebook contains initial "playing" with BGPMon data; specifically, a set
of data from one hour on November 1st, 2018 was used. After preprocessing had
been completed, the set included over 250,000 BGP update/announcement messages,
and over 30,000 "unique" events in terms of prefix, prefix mask, and final AS
destination.

The notebook explores different aspects of the data, as well as how
time-interval factors play a role for such BGP messages.
